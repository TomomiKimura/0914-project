          <div class="small-title">Lima is now 5 months old!</div>
          <p>
            Her name is LIMA. We named her name Lima after a character called
            Lima from "Saber Marionette". The character is very energetic and
            pure and we both liked her. Also, when we were thinking about her
            name, we were talking about unique but cute name, then we were
            saying random words, then a word "Lemon" popped up. Lemon is "Lima"
            in Spanish which my husband's mother language. She is Shiba. Oh yes,
            obviously, SHIBA! But I still want to mention it, because she
            sometimes acts like a cat and looks like a corgi and a fox. Her
            birthday is April 11th, 2021. We welcomed Lima in June. Our cute
            loving family member, Lima has already become 5 months this month!

          <p>
            My husband and I are dog lovers. We like visiting pet shops to find
            cute dogs. We always talked about what-if-we-have-a-dog talks, but
            did not happen until this day. YES! The day we met Lima! When we saw
            her in petshop, we both were like "awwwwwwww..." then, we held her
            in our arms. Then yes, we were like "aawwwwwwwwwwwww..." Then yes,
            title says, "Take me home", but it was more like "Come home with
            us....!" We signed a contract, and now we are all together!

        <div class="upperright">
          <div class="small-title">Her Way of Communication</div>
          <p> When she is excited and happy, she shows her tongue excitedly, then
            says "awoooooooooooo, awo, awo, awooooooooon." When she is calm
            which is super cute, she comes at you. When we are sitting so that
            she cannot reach us much, she still comes at our feet and rest on
            our foot. This really melts our heart. SO CUTE! And when she eats
            carrots and paprika, I cut them long enough, then she holds a carrot
            by her both front feet elegantly. SO CUTE. She really makes us laugh
            and happy in daily life.</p>

            <a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/life-lessons-from-dogs/" >1. Tolet</a></div>
          <p>We struggled to teach her the toilet in the beginning, but she has
          learned quite fast which we really appreciated and happy about.</p></div>

          <div class="link-title">
            <a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/life-lessons-from-dogs/" >2. Sleep</a></div>
          <p>Well, she sleeps perfectly. She goes to bed between 10-11pm and
          wakes up around 7am now. She used to wake up 6am when we just got
          her, calling us to free her. But now, she has got used to our
          lifestyle so that she can wait quietly until we wake up around 6 or
          7am without barking or anything. Smart Lima chin!</p></div>

          <div class="link-title">
            <a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/life-lessons-from-dogs/" >3.Personality</a></div>
          <p>She is very curious, but careful. She is very careful with new
          things, but once she gets used to them, she gets so energetic and
          excited. She really likes people (which I really like). Whenever we
          have friends coming over, she gets so happy and excited. She smells
          and lick them instead of biting! ...well, she bites too, but not too
          hard now. She has learned about strength, but she usually LOVES
          biting things.</p></div>

            <a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/life-lessons-from-dogs/" >4.Likes and Dislikes</a></div>
          <p>I have said she liked people above. She really likes people outside
          too. When we meet some people walking their dogs, she literally goes
          to the owners and ask for patting. haha Also, she loves eating,
          playing, and walking. She really likes her dog food (which is very
          helpful for us), carrot,and paprika, and daison. We found out
          recently that she doesn't like lever. My husband and I don't like
          lever much either, so I felt we are more family now. ('')<p/></div>

        <p>One of the things I really like about Lima chin is her expressions.
        It might be more like a Shiba thing, but they really make me laugh.
        Especially the times I really stressed out from work, her
        expressions and how she is really helped me to switch my mind. When
        we play with her, she really gets excited and happy. ,We throw toys
        happily imagine her chasing energetically, but sometimes out of
        nowhere, she just look at thrown toys flowing the air with poker
        face and just sitting as if she has no interest. (although she was
        chasing them so much like a second ago!)</p></div>
